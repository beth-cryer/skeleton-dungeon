SKELETON SAVES THE DUNGEON

Genre is a dungeon-crawling RPG
Entire game is turn-based, including combat, picking up/dropping items, equipping/unequipping items, etc.
Player has a maximum number of actions per turn (starts as 1 of each action type)
Player can move 1 tile at a time, up to a set distance maximum per turn
Enemies play by the same rules, with a set number of actions they can take per turn

Actions Allowed = Movement, Item Use, Attack, Environment Interaction
Interactions with tiles can include: breaking an obstacle, activating a switch, etc.

STATS:
Health (damage taken before death)
Stamina (max tiles moved per turn. certain milestones grant additional item/attack uses)
Strength (chance to hit with melee)
Ranged (chance to hit with projectile)
Magic (chance to hit with spells, also affects max number of spellcasts per floor)
Defence (chance for enemies to miss)

-Health and Stamina increase automatically on level-up
-All others can be allocated by the player on level-up
Essentially the choice will be whether to focus on one stat and be very good at that combat type,
or spread the stats out to better take advantage of enemy weaknesses

ITEMS:
Weapons - each has a different base chance to hit, also determines damage upon hit
Armour - lighter armour gives higher Initiative, heavier armour gives higher Defence bonus
Consumables - restores health, stamina or magic, can also buff stats for X turns

	MELEE
Sword - high damage, 1 tile range
Spear - med damage, but 2 tile range
Dagger - lower damage, but gets 1 extra attack per turn and can be thrown
	RANGED
Bow - med damage, variable tile range
Staff/Spellbook - high damage, variable tile range, limited uses

Enemies:
Can attack through MELEE or RANGED, each of which can be either PHYS or MAG
Each enemy has a weakness. Attacking with this type gives a x1.25 damage bonus

Zombie (PHYS MELEE, weak to MELEE/MAG RANGED)
Mummy (MAG MELEE, weak to MAG)
Direwolf (MELEE, weak to PHYS)
Ghost (MAG MELEE, weak to MAG)
Minotaur (PHYS MELEE, weak to RANGED)

Elf (PHYS RANGED, weak to MELEE)
Orc (PHYS RANGED, weak to MAG)
Cultist (MAG RANGED, weak to PHYS)
Lich (MAG RANGED/SUPPORT, weak to PHYS)

Troll (PHYS MELEE/PHYS RANGED, strong against PHYS)
Dragon (PHYS MELEE/MAG RANGED, strong against MAG)


WORLD
Each floor of the dungeon has a single, semi-randomly generated room
Rooms will be large enough that scrolling is required
Will have a set of template level files that are pulled from when entering a new room
Templates will include the wall positions, and then a set of flags for possible spawn locations of each level object

ROOM PROPERTIES
Type - determines which wall and floor tiles are used, as well as which enemy types can spawn
Level - determines the difficulty level of the room

LEVEL OBJECTS
Enemies
Chests (containing new items)
Entrance
Exit (can only be opened by a key dropped by a random enemy in the room, or found in a chest)


FLOOR PROPERTIES
enemies get stronger for every floor cleared
following properties are random, but have a higher chance at deeper levels:
1 - (CAVE) no special properties
2 - (LABYRINTH) bigger level, weaker enemies
3 - (SAND) need to move every turn or lose health to quicksand. enemies also take passive damage though
4 - (POISON) lose health at the end of every turn, but magic does more damage
5 - (ANTIMAGIC) mana is halved, but melee is stronger
6 - (ICE) stamina is halved, but you move two tiles at a time
7 - (ABYSS) must finish before a certain number of turns. floor has more treasure
8 - (BLOOD) all damage taken is doubled, but so is exp gained
number represents both rarity and deadliness

MARKING CRITERIA
1. will have a state manager that handles different states within battles
2. will save player and enemy positions, along with player stats and inventory (maybe)
3. enemies' movement and behaviour will be automated, with multiple enemy subclasses
4. hopefully my game will be impressive.

A 1.scrolling and zooming - maps will be large enough to require this
B 2.advanced animation - most objects will be animated via sprite sheets
C 2.interesting tile manager - will probably have some animated tiles
D 1.new displayable objects - this will be required for creating projectiles and spawning enemies
E 1.user input text - for entering character name
H 1.Image rotation - ranged projectiles will point towards target
