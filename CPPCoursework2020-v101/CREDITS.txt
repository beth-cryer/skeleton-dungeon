Some Music and SFX from RPG Maker, which I own a copy of
+ Darren Curtis' Commercially Free Music
+ some stuff from a game soundpack I bought ages ago on Humble Bundle (Mega Music Collection)

Enemy and Player sprites are from Heroes of Might and Magic II, released 1996 (ripped by Cyrus Annihilator)

Weapons and Items are mostly from Terraria

Background Tiles and some Items are from the Dokucraft Texture Pack for Minecraft (which apparently is free to use)
